						'The premise for the seniorcareonline “Bloom” app was developed decades ago when a mature senior medical student was subletting housing from a senior citizen, and offsetting her expenses and providing purpose and reliable companionship. Many senior citizens needing companionship, greater supervision and even help to maintain independence and autonomy, need a tool to connect them with caregivers called to serve senior citizens. Having seen the process of finding and connecting seniors and caregivers as more random and haphazard over the years, our simple approach is to change this by facilitating the connection of these two groups and focus on key needs and wishes and match them online as closely as possible. We appropriately combine strict background checks, skill set requirements, educational prowess, and passion for our philosophy into each caregiver match.',

Our caregiver screening questions include evidence-based, scientifically sound questions which result in almost 40% better outcomes. Our screening demands an honest answer to ensure that our caregivers are looking to fulfill a calling to serve others rather than just find another job.",
